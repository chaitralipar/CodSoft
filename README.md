# Sales-prediction
Sales prediction using simple linear regression is a common technique in business analytics and data science. It involves using historical sales data to build a linear relationship between one independent variable (usually a predictor) and the dependent variable (sales). Here are key techniques and steps involved in this process:

Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning
Data Transformation
Data Visualization

Coefficient Interpretation
Intercept Interpretation

#Prediction:

Using the trained regression model to make sales predictions for future periods or scenarios based on new values of the predictor.

Model Validation

Validate the model's performance using a separate dataset or through cross-validation techniques to ensure it generalizes well.

Monitoring and Maintenance

Simple linear regression is a fundamental technique for sales prediction, and it serves as a foundation for more complex regression models when multiple predictors are involved (multiple linear regression) or when time series aspects are considered (time series forecasting).
