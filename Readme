The Iris dataset is a well-known classification problem in machine learning. It consists of iris flowers categorized into three species based on sepal and petal measurements. The goal is to train a model to accurately classify them as setosa, versicolor, or virginica. It's often used as an introductory classification task due to its simplicity and clarity.
